## Description
## QUESTION 1
# ALU Student Registration System

The ALU Student Registration System is a set of shell scripts designed to manage student records for the Bachelor of Software Engineering program at ALU (African Leadership University). This project includes scripts for creating, viewing, deleting, and updating student records, as well as extracting and storing student email addresses.

## Features

- Create student records by providing email, age, and student ID.
- Save and manage student records in a file named `students-list_0923.txt`.
- View a list of all students stored in the system.
- Delete a student record by specifying the student ID.
- Update student records by modifying email and age information.
- Extract and save student email addresses to a file named `student-emails.txt`.
- Organize and move project files to a separate directory.


## Question 2
# Automation with Linux

In Question 2, we have developed a set of shell scripts to automate the organization and backup of project files to a remote server. This section provides an overview of the two scripts: `move-to-directory.sh` and `backup-Negpod_5.sh`.


## Built With

- Bash Shell

## Requirements

- **Bash Shell**: The scripts are written in Bash and require a Bash-compatible shell.

## Getting Started

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository to your local machine**:

  
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/summative-2_Negpod_5.git



**2. Navigate to the project directory:**


      cd summative-2_Negpod_5

 
**3. Check the files in the project directory:**



    ls


**4. Make the script files executable:**

    chmod +x main.sh select-emails.sh 

## QUESTION 1 USAGE

To use the ALU Student Registration System, follow these steps:

**1. Run the main application script to interact with the system:**


      ./main.sh

This script will display a menu where you can create, view, delete, update student records, and more.

**2. Extract and save student email addresses:**
  
  
      ./select-emails.sh

This script will create a file named student-emails.txt containing the extracted email addresses.

## QUESTION 2 USAGE

### 1. Move Files to a Directory

The `move-to-directory.sh` script is designed to enhance project file organization. It creates a dedicated directory with the name `negpod_id-q1` and moves all files created in Question 1 into this directory. This simplifies the management of project files and ensures they are stored in a structured manner

### 2. Backup to a Remote Server

The `backup-Negpod_5.sh` script allows us to create a backup of the `negpod_id-q1` directory and transfer it to a remote server. This script is designed to work with the provided remote server details.


### 3. Make the script files executable

    
    chmod +x move-to-directory.sh backup-Negpod_5.sh
    


## Testing
